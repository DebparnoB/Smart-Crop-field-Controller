A novel scheme is proposed here to build up a water-saving automated irrigation cum pump controller which exploits the advantage of Fuzzy logic, 802.11 based serial Wi-Fi (P2P) wireless sensor network (WSN) and IoT to monitor the field and supply water, fertilizer and environmental data timely. The sensor array consists of soil moisture, toxic gas sensor, pH and ultrasonic sensors to amass information like soil moisture, nutrient efficiency of crops and water level regularly. Along with this, the information obtained from the local weather station via GSM/Wi-Fi network such as air temperature, humidity and the weather forecast are logged to battery powered Arduino Fuzzy controller installed on the field as well as Thingspeak cloud to make a decision if the soil actually needs watering and the amount of water to avoid mineral loss and rotting the plants using recycling of water which can provide a scientific basis for water-saving irrigation. The time to time monitoring and logging the filed data to online cloud helps farmers decide about the crops to be planted, sowing seeds and the requirement of fertilizer through SMS/Call facility of cell- phone. The system can call the farmer or vice-versa to turn on/off the pump to water the land as and when required in a password protected manner allowing the control to the authorized person only, in the form of stored voice messages in regional language. The novelty of the proposed system is in case of any emergency weather forecast (torrential rain or drought) obtained from the local weather station, system can adjust the predefined time for watering and monitoring the land thereby making it an intelligent decision-making system. The excess water due to heavy rain fall is stored in reservoir by controlling two pumps wirelessly for future irrigation in case of shortage of rainfall. The system also can automatically maintain the entire duration of different crops to be watered in a season.

# PROBLEM DEFINITION  
In many places of the world, irrigation is conventionally aimed to accomplish the optimum supply of water to the roots of the plant or crops while maintaining the water level of the soil as much close to field capacity as possible to enhance productivity. To avoid the moisture stress during the growing season when the crops and fruits are ripe, constant irrigation is necessary with normal rainfall. The increasing demand of the food supplies requires a rapid improvement in food production technology. The motivation of this project came from the countries where agriculture plays an important part in shaping up the economy and the climatic conditions are isotropic but still we are not able to make full use of agricultural resources because of lack of rains, incessant rains, and uncontrolled supply of land reservoir water and manual intervention of controlling water pump.  As agriculture uses a lot of water, extraction of water at regular intervals from earth is reducing the water level as a result of which the zones of un-irrigated land are gradually increasing. In addition to that, the uncontrolled use of water supply leads to wastage of water inadvertently. Though water seems abundant, however, less than 1% of the world’s liquid freshwater is available for human use and about 70% of it is used for irrigation. Different plants do not share the same traits especially about the amount of water needed. There are some plants like paddy in India which needs to be watered regularly with the water level sustained at around 20cm at the root. On the contrary cactus just requires the sprinkling twice in a week. As the proper flow of water determines the plants to survive so the moisture content i.e. Humidity of the soil must be monitored to prevent the crops from losing strength.  Unfortunately, old fashioned manual farming targets the watering of plant roots without any precision. The farmers irrigate the land at regular intervals by turning the water-pump on/off as and when required. This process is time consuming and sometimes the water supply to the land is delayed due to which the crops dry out. Water deficiency deteriorates plants growth before visible wilting occurs. If supplemental irrigation of optimum amount of water is not done in proper time then procrastinating irrigation could lead to a massive loss affecting country’s economy adversely. Secondly the farmers don’t accommodate with anisotropic weather as various factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind affects the environment severely thereby changing the consumption of water needed to survive the plant drastically. Had the local weather elements been monitored and logged regularly with the soil moisture and the water level as well then, the water would be used more effectively and exactly on time when the plant needs watering.  So, it is important to minimize the wastage of water and the exact timing to sprinkle the plant as well which motivated researchers an emphasis on developing methods of irrigation to reduce large water loss i.e. maximize the use of water efficiently. Thus, it is proved that the automated irrigation system can serve many purposes straddling from watering plant at times to effective use of the water in dry land and where water supply is scarce and finally reducing the manual intervention of controlling water pump so that the end user like farmer, gardener can use it efficiently to water their land. 

# PLANNING & APPROACH

The automated irrigation system comprises of this soil moisture sensor, water level sensor and a control mechanism to turn on/off the irrigation components like water pump or solenoid valve. Among different methods of irrigation scheduling ranging from plant, soil, or climate based, soil-based technique is used widely which involves soil tensiometers or dielectric probes to measure the moisture content of the soil regularly. It is such an instrument which, when planted in a soil for a period of time, provides information related to the soil water status of that soil. 
 Some substantial works have been done by the researchers on soil-moisture based irrigation system and water level measurement techniques using micro-controller as well.  However most of these solutions appear to be very expensive and the complexity can’t be handled by the farmer as well. There have been some other examples where researchers have made the irrigation automated with the use of low-cost custom-made humidity and temperature sensors and simple circuitry aiming a low-cost product that can be bought even by a poor farmer.

It is essential for the farmers to know the exact time to sprinkle the plant and the amount of water needed to maintain the desired dryness or wetness of the land beforehand so that he can turn on/off the pump as and when required. With the advancement of the DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) technology and later on GSM (Global System for Mobile) evolution, the wireless mobile communication has made it possible for the farmers to monitor the land conditions even sitting back at home. One of the GSM controlled automatic irrigation system is prompted here which enter the field details into a database and generate a variety of reports to the irrigation data for statistical analysis.  The system is aimed to the farmers who usually lie in low income range especially in country like India. The farmer doesn’t necessarily need to possess the expensive smartphone and internet connection to monitor and control the entire irrigation process. In addition to that the telephonic conversation taking place between the DTMF+GSM module installed in the server node and the farmer will be in regional language thereby helping the village people understand everything with ease.

The soil moisture, the nutrient deficiency is tested using pH mater and logged locally and globally to cloud which helps the system to know if the pesticide is needed and when. The information is also served to the farmer in the form of call or SMS. Lastly a novel ultrasonic sensor-based water level detector is designed to measure the level of water in the field. It seems to be immensely useful in case of excess or shortage of rainfall. If the water level exceeds the desired level then an outlet pump will drain off the excess of water to the reservoir which can be further used when drought occurs thereby recycling the water.

We prompt a cost effective yet robust IoT based intelligent irrigation controller which can not only automatically turn on/off the pump installed in the field to water the plant at precise time but also it periodically monitors the soil condition and updates to the cloud database for future use. The proposed system requires the farmer to install a wireless battery powered unit which consist of soil moisture sensor, toxic gas sensor, ultrasonic water level detector and pH sensor hooked up with a serial Wi-Fi transceiver module ESP8266. The toxic gas sensor is used to detect the presence of ammonia or methane which will indicate the farmer of any case of rotting of plants. Widely used IEEE 802.15.4 Xbee interface on the contrary is costly and needs an embedded microcontroller to get it working which has prompted us to search for a new wireless client-server solution. So, we have taken up this NODE MCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi module which can also be operated as a standalone device and doesn’t need any other microcontroller to make it work as it contains a built-in controller along with the Wi-Fi module. The ESP continuously sends enormous amount of data in the form of packets and frame (date, time, source address, destination address, data, ERC) which can easily reach to the destination mode and be monitored on cloud. Such separate WSN modules, known as end node or client, are to be implanted at the different parts of the field to be cultivated. The sensor Data are sent from each end sensor node to the Teal Time Clock (RTC) based co-ordination node which is the heart of the system consisting of custommade Arduino board, the ESP12 Wi-Fi module acting in server mode, DTMF+GSM module and the relay board to drive the inlet and outlet motor and solenoid to water the plant as well. The cost-effective ESP module performs two-fold actions: on one hand it acts as the wireless transceiver and the on-chip controller sends the collected chunk of data from the array of sensors to the nearest access point or server on the other. The soil moisture sensor is implanted in the field to monitor the moisture (humidity) content of the soil and send it to the client ESP. The server ESP module is responsible for taking a precise decision to water the plant as and when required based on the received data of soil moisture conditions from all its clients. The updated status of the field will be delivered to the farmer by calling or sending SMS to his predefined cell-phone. The real time data of soil conditions are uploaded to Thingspeak cloud server regularly via WiFi which can be monitored remotely and can be used for future reference of irrigation. The RTC helps the system to set the exact duration of the irrigation of different crops in the entire season. It will further be enhanced by the fuzzy logic implemented in Arduino platform to set the soil moisture dynamically by continuous monitoring not only the dryness and wetness but also from the previous (say last season) data received from the cloud database for particular type of crops. For every specific crop, there must be a span of irrigation (say 3 months) in which the watering is not uniform in nature-requires more water at the nascent days but gradually decreases with the time. This is where IoT service providers become handy making the system more intelligent to take the decision without any human intervention. However, the system also intimates the farmer to expedite or slower the watering process base on the real time soil conditions and the historical data.   

# COCLUSION
The Smart Agriculture has to be used for an effective growth of the crop and by using it we can maintain the health of the crop. This is relatively a modern research field and 
it is expected to grow in future. There is lot of work to be done on this emerging area. Here we get a basic knowledge that how the quality of the soil and the atmospheric 
conditions are time to time judged and are uploaded to ThingSpeak cloud. According to the soil quality the water pumps are switched on or off automatically or manually 
(when required). The real time data uploaded to the cloud are being accessed by the Agricultural Research team for further analysis which helps for the better growth of the 
crop and its production, in farming of the Smart Agriculture.
